Please feel free to read the project description pdf for a better overview of how the system operates. Feel free to watch the video for a narrated video of operation. Also feel free to read through the ladder logic pdfs.  You are welcome to download the project files for testing, but setting up DDE can be very tedious and painful depending on your system configuration.  It is recommended to watch the video demo if you are curious about how things work.
